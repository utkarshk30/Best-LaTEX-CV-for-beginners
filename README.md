### Setup
To compile this tex, Please ensure that you have LaTeX installed on your machine, in order to generate the resumes. [Head over here](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) to download it.
  
Alternatively, if you'd like you can use a site like [OverLeaf](https://overleaf.com) to build and edit your LaTeX instead and use xelatex compiler. I would recommend overleaf for anyone.

The Resume generated will be ATS-friendly and awesome especially if you are a student or beginner.

### And remember...

>“Everyone appreciates a well-designed resume. Its design, however, should not determine whether or not you are hired.”
